# JavaScript Study Questions

### Understanding Values
1. What is a **value** in JavaScript, and why is it considered the most fundamental unit of information? (IQ)  
2. What will be the output of the following code?  
   ```javascript
   console.log("Jonas");
   console.log(23);
   console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10);
   ```

### Storing Values in Variables

3. How do you declare a variable in JavaScript and assign the value `"Jonas"` to it?

   ```javascript
   // Fill in the code
   ```
4. Explain the analogy of variables being like "boxes" in programming.
5. If you declare `let firstName = "Jonas";` and then reassign `firstName = "Matilda";`, what will `console.log(firstName)` print?
6. Why is it useful to store values in variables instead of hardcoding them multiple times? (IQ)

### Variable Naming Conventions and Rules

7. What is **camelCase**, and why is it the standard naming convention in JavaScript?
8. Show an example of a variable name written with underscores (`snake_case`) that is still valid in JavaScript.
9. Why can’t variable names start with a number in JavaScript? Write an example of an illegal variable declaration.

   ```javascript
   // Example of invalid code
   ```
10. What characters are allowed in JavaScript variable names?
11. Why can’t reserved keywords like `new` or `function` be used as variable names? What workaround exists if you want a similar name?
12. What is the difference between variables that start with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and all-uppercase letters? (IQ)
13. Why are constants usually written in all uppercase letters? Provide an example.

### Descriptive Variable Names

14. Which is better for readability, `let job1 = "programmer";` or `let myFirstJob = "programmer";`, and why?
15. Why should variable names be descriptive in JavaScript code? (IQ)

### Recap: What is a Variable?

16. In your own words, explain what a variable is and how it works. (IQ)
17. If the following code is executed, what will be logged to the console?

```javascript
let myFirstJob = "programmer";
let myCurrentJob = "teacher";
myFirstJob = "coder";
console.log(myFirstJob);
```

18. Why are variables considered one of the most important concepts in programming? (IQ)

### Key Takeaways

19. Summarize the key points about values and variables in JavaScript.
20. Why do naming conventions and readability matter in programming for long-term code maintenance? (IQ)
