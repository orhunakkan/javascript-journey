# A Brief Introduction to JavaScript

## Introduction to JavaScript
You have already written a line or two of JavaScript, but what exactly is JavaScript and what can we do with it?  
In this lecture, we will set the stage for the rest of the course. It is really important that you follow this one until the end.

We can define JavaScript in many different ways. My definition is that it is a **high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language**. But what does any of that actually mean? Let's deconstruct this a little bit to make some sense out of it.

---

## Programming Language
A programming language is basically a tool that allows us to write code that instructs a computer to do something.  
This is our main goal of using JavaScript.

---

## High-Level Language
JavaScript is a high-level language, which means we do not have to think about complex details such as managing the computer's memory while it runs a program.  
JavaScript provides many abstractions over these small details, making the language easier to write and learn.

---

## Object-Oriented
JavaScript is object-oriented, meaning the language is mostly based on the concept of **objects** for storing most kinds of data.  
We will learn all about object-oriented programming throughout this course.

---

## Multi-Paradigm
JavaScript is also a multi-paradigm language, which means it is **flexible and versatile**.  
We can use different programming styles such as **imperative** and **declarative programming**. These are just different ways of structuring our code.

## Role of JavaScript in Web Development
Now that we know what JavaScript is, what role does it play in web development?  
To answer this, let's look at the three core technologies of the web:

- **HTML** â†’ Responsible for the content of the page (text, images, buttons, etc.).
- **CSS** â†’ Responsible for styling and layout (the look and feel).
- **JavaScript** â†’ The real programming language of the internet. It adds dynamic and interactive effects.

JavaScript is also used to:
- Manipulate content or CSS
- Load data from remote servers
- Build entire web applications in the browser

---

## Analogy: Nouns, Adjectives, and Verbs
- **HTML â†’ Noun** â†’ Defines the element (e.g., a `<p>` is a paragraph).
- **CSS â†’ Adjective** â†’ Describes the element (e.g., text is red).
- **JavaScript â†’ Verb** â†’ Performs an action (e.g., hide the paragraph).

---

## Real Example: Twitter Web Application
- On Twitter, when opening a profile page, you see **spinners** while JavaScript loads data from the server.
- Once data arrives, JavaScript hides the spinners and displays the content.
- JavaScript also:
    - Shows and hides the tweet box
    - Loads user info dynamically on hover
    - Adds interactive effects throughout the site

---

## Recap and Further Possibilities
JavaScript allows us to:
- Add dynamic effects to pages
- Build full web applications in the browser
- Make modern, interactive, and responsive apps

Frameworks like **React, Angular, Vue** are based on JavaScript, but mastering **vanilla JavaScript** is critical before learning them.

---

## JavaScript Beyond the Browser
JavaScript can also run outside browsers:
- **Node.js** â†’ Run JavaScript on a server, interact with databases, and build backend apps.
- **In the Browser** â†’ Build front-end apps.

Future possibilities include:
- Native mobile apps (**React Native**, **Ionic**)
- Desktop apps (**Electron**)

ðŸ‘‰ With JavaScript, the possibilities are nearly endless.

---

## JavaScript Releases and Versions
- Major update in **2015** â†’ ES2015 (also called **ES6**).
- Since then, **new features are released yearly**.
- Everything after ES2015 is considered **modern JavaScript**.
- We will also learn key ES5 concepts for historical context.

---

## Key Takeaways
- JavaScript is a **high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm** language.
- It works alongside **HTML** and **CSS** to create modern web apps.
- Runs both in **browsers (frontend)** and **servers (backend with Node.js)**.
- Mastering JavaScript fundamentals is essential before moving to frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.
